# Kettlebell Workouts

*Everyone wants to be strong, but ain't nobody want to lift heavy weight.* - Pete Muskett

Well, you can probably get pretty strong without having to lift heavy weight every day, at least according to the probably hundreds of videos appearing in my social media feeds of dads promising functional, lifelong fitness that will mentally and physically prepare you for any challenge, ranging from driving to work, to house chores, to making sure the entire neighborhood knows you are better than them while you complete your Joe Rogan-esque kettle bell workout in your garage at the end of the cul-de-sac.

Yeah, I guess that's enough for me to give it a try.

In fairness - it's also a great workout that helps build functional strength far better than standard, static movements that only engage one muscle.  
Kettlebell workouts will meet my goal of time-optimized full body engagement that improves broader movement strength and flexibility.  It may not grow muscles in the same way as repeated isolation exercises in the gym, but will improve athleticism and strength.
